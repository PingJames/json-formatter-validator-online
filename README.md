JSON is everywhere — APIs, configuration files, logs — but invalid JSON is still one of the most common problems developers face.

Missing commas, extra trailing characters, or incorrect quotes can easily break your application.

## Common Causes of Invalid JSON

Here are some typical issues:
- Trailing commas
- Missing quotation marks
- Incorrect brackets
- Copy-paste errors from logs

## Why Manual Fixing Is Inefficient

Manually fixing JSON becomes painful when:
- The file is large
- The structure is deeply nested
- Errors are not obvious

## Automatically Fix JSON Online
